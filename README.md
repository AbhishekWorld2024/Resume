# Resume
Pursuing a Masterâ€™s in Computer Science at the University of Kansas, I am passionate about leveraging data insights and technology to solve real-world challenges.

I bring hands-on experience from Cognizant Technology Solutions, where I worked as a Programmer Analyst specializing in automation testing, microservices, and backend optimization with tools like Selenium and Spring Boot. My internship as a QA Engineer focused on enhancing application efficiency and user testing in payment systems. Additionally, my recent projects include a healthcare data privacy framework and a Boolean Satisfiability Solver using the DPLL algorithm.

I am continuously seeking to enhance my skills and stay updated with industry trends to bring fresh perspectives to every project.
