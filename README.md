<h2>SUMMARY</h2>
Pursuing a Master’s in Computer Science at the University of Kansas, I am passionate about leveraging data insights and technology to solve real-world challenges.<br>

I bring hands-on experience from Cognizant Technology Solutions, where I worked as a Programmer Analyst specializing in automation testing, backend optimization, and microservices development. My expertise includes designing scalable backend systems with Spring Boot, optimizing database interactions using Hibernate, and integrating RESTful APIs for seamless communication. My internship as a QA Engineer focused on enhancing application efficiency and user testing in payment systems. Additionally, my recent projects include a healthcare data privacy framework and a Boolean Satisfiability Solver using the DPLL algorithm.<br>

I am continuously seeking to enhance my skills and stay updated with industry trends to bring fresh perspectives to every project.<br><br>

<h2>Projects</h2><br>
<h3>DIFFERENTIAL PRIVACY ON HEALTHCARE</h3><br>
->In this project, we presented a comprehensive framework that integrates state-of-the-art
privacy-preserving techniques, addressing the critical privacy concern in healthcare data.<br>
->The main goal of our project is to strengthen the confidentiality of individual records by
implementing differential privacy, a paradigm that is widely acknowledged. The Laplace
mechanism is utilized to incorporate precisely calibrated noise into numeric columns in the database, like
'Age,' 'Billing Amount,' and 'Room Number,' maintaining data integrity while augmenting
privacy.<br>
->Data masking is incorporated to anonymize columns, like 'Medical
Condition' and 'Name,' by restricting their representation to a specific maximum length.<br>
->Applying hashing to tokenization, specific columns such as 'Hospital,' 'Insurance Provider,' and
'Medication' are protected against security breaches.<br>
->To give users concrete control over the degree of privacy they desire to
preserve, the project presents the idea of a privacy budget (ε) as a parameter. <br>
-> This comprehensive method yields a refined healthcare dataset, establishing the groundwork for
responsible data handling and adding to the ongoing conversation about privacy in the
healthcare industry.<br>
